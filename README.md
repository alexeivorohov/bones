# bones - freaky example of NN on C#

Once a day during my master's program in theoretical physics, dubious task has been set ...

This code is my attempt to make a reasonable answer on this task:
1) Adequate pipeline for operating with 1d fully-connected NN's in C# is provided.
2) Basic activation functions, loss functions and learning strategies are implemented.
3) Several normalization techniques are realized.
